1
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:16,410
Pull yourself together, Teddy.
Pull yourself together.

2
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,502
It's just water.

3
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,671
It's a lot of water.

4
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,006
A lot of...

5
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,637
Come on.

6
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,831
- You okay, boss?
- Yeah, I'm fine, I just...

7
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,709
I just can't... Can't stomach the water.

8
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:11,882
- You're my new partner.
- That's right.

9
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:16,011
Not the best way to meet,
with my head halfway down the toilet.

10
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:19,098
Doesn't exactly square with
"Teddy Daniels, the man, the legend,"

11
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,642
- I'll give you that.
- The legend?

12
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,395
What the hell you boys smoking
over there in Portland, anyway?

13
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,857
Seattle. I came from
the office in Seattle.

14
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:32,736
How long you been with the Marshals?

15
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,238
Four years.

16
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,159
So you know how small it is.

17
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:39,660
Sure.

18
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:43,664
What about you?
You got a girl? Married?

19
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,749
I was.

20
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,221
She died.

21
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:03,184
- Jesus. I don't...
- Don't worry about it.

22
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,813
There was a fire at the apartment
building while I was at work.

23
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:09,607
Four people died.

24
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,569
It was the smoke that got her,
not the fire. See, that's important.

25
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,321
I'm sorry, boss.

26
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,240
Where are my goddamn cigarettes?

27
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,367
Oh, here, have one of mine.

28
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:23,954
I could've sworn they were
in my jacket before I got on.

29
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,749
Government employees
will rob you blind.

30
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,419
Thanks.

31
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:34,256
They give you a briefing about
the institution before you left?

32
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,967
All I know is it's a mental hospital.

33
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,386
For the criminally insane.

34
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,140
Well, if it's just folks running
around hearing voices

35
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:46,644
and chasing after butterflies,
they wouldn't need us.

36
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,656
- Is that where we're headed?
- Yep.

37
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,533
The other side of the island
is rock bluffs

38
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:04,161
all the way down
to the edge of the water.

39
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:07,706
The dock, it's the only way on or off.

40
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,794
We'll be casting off
as soon as you two are ashore.

41
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,505
I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry up about it.

42
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,299
- Why?
- Storm's coming.

43
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,328
Never seen a Marshals badge before.

44
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:49,873
I'm Deputy Warden McPherson,
gentlemen.

45
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,166
Welcome to Shutter Island.

46
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,253
I'll be the one taking you
up to Ashecliffe.

47
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:09,435
Your boys seem a little on edge,
Mr. McPherson.

48
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,895
Right now, Marshal, we all are.

49
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,192
Electrified perimeter.

50
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,779
How can you tell?

51
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,698
I've seen something like it before.

52
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:37,147
All right. You gentlemen will be accorded
all the help we can give,

53
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,192
but during your stay,
you will obey protocol.

54
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,652
Is that understood?

55
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,112
Absolutely.

56
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,949
The red brick building on your right
is Ward A, the male ward.

57
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,369
Ward B, the female ward,
is the one on your left.

58
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,414
Ward C is that building on the bluffs.

59
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,124
An old Civil War fort.

60
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,584
The most dangerous patients
are housed there.

61
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,628
Admittance to Ward C is forbidden

62
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,339
without the written consent
and physical presence

63
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:05,008
of both myself and Dr. Cawley.

64
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,844
Is that understood?

65
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,222
You act like insanity is catching.

66
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,353
You are hereby required
to surrender your firearms.

67
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:21,233
Mr. McPherson, we are duly appointed
federal marshals.

68
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,861
We are required to carry our firearms
with us at all times.

69
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,905
Executive order 319
of the Federal Code of Penitentiaries

70
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:29,032
states that when inside a penitentiary,

71
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,536
the officers of that institution
have final authority.

72
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:39,418
Gentlemen, you will not get through
this gate with your firearms.

73
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:02,191
Okay. Now that the official stuff's done,
come on, boys,

74
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,193
what do you say we go find Dr. Cawley?

75
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,916
When did she escape? This prisoner?

76
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:23,170
I'm afraid Dr. Cawley will have
to fill you in on the situation. Protocol.

77
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,422
Correctional officers
at a mental institution,

78
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,633
that's a weird sight,
if you don't mind me saying.

79
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:31,136
It's the only facility
of its kind in the U.S., even the world.

80
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,764
We take only the most dangerous,
damaged patients,

81
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,807
ones no other hospital can manage.

82
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,809
And it's all due to Dr. Cawley.

83
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,811
He's created something
really unique here.

84
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:43,482
It's a hospital for people our society
normally considers beyond treatment.

85
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,050
Top of his class
at Johns Hopkins, then Harvard...

86
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,220
IDs, gentlemen.

87
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,850
Show your badges, gentlemen.

88
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:22,938
Dr. Cawley's been consulted
numerous times by Scotland Yard,

89
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,440
- MI5, the OSS...
- Why?

90
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,151
What do you mean?

91
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,739
What do intelligence agencies
want to consult a psychiatrist about?

92
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:35,117
I guess you'll have to ask him.

93
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,004
- Marshal Daniels.
- Doctor.

94
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,047
Marshal Aule.

95
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,217
Thank you, Deputy Warden.
That will be all.

96
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,970
Yes, sir. Pleasure, gentlemen.

97
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,348
He had a lot to say about you.

98
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,602
McPherson's a good man.
He believes in the work we do here.

99
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:04,021
And what would that be, exactly?

100
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,733
A moral fusion between law and order
and clinical care.

101
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,819
Pardon me, Doc.
A what between what and what?

102
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,871
Those paintings are quite accurate.

103
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,831
Used to be the kind of patients
we deal with here

104
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:26,084
were shackled and left in their own filth.

105
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,461
They were beaten,

106
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,796
as if whipping them bloody
would drive the psychosis out.

107
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,007
We drove screws into their brains,

108
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:35,886
we submerged them in icy water
until they lost consciousness

109
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,430
or even drowned.

110
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,474
- And now?
- We treat them.

111
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,768
Try to heal, try to cure.

112
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,519
And if that fails,
at least we provide them

113
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,856
with a measure of comfort
in their lives. Calm.

114
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:51,151
These are all violent offenders, right?

115
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,487
I mean, they've hurt people.

116
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,991
- Murdered them in some cases.
- In almost all cases, yes.

117
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,910
Then, personally, Doctor,
I'd have to say,

118
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,371
screw their sense of calm.

119
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:07,751
It's my job to treat my patients,
not their victims. I'm not here to judge.

120
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:10,420
- So this female prisoner...
- Patient.

121
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,173
Excuse me. Patient,

122
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:18,387
one Rachel Solando,
escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.

123
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:22,349
- Last night between 10:00 and midnight.
- Is she considered dangerous?

124
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,061
You could say that.
She killed all three of her children.

125
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,898
She drowned them in the lake
behind her house.

126
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,276
She took them out one by one,
held their heads under till they died,

127
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,196
then she brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table.

128
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,616
She ate a meal there
before a neighbor dropped by.

129
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,744
And what about the husband?

130
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:46,498
He died on the beaches of Normandy.
She's a war widow.

131
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,584
She starved herself
when she first came here.

132
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,462
She insisted the children weren't dead.

133
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,058
Sorry, Doctor. You don't happen
to have an aspirin, do you?

134
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,894
- Prone to headaches, Marshal?
- Sometimes. But today,

135
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:11,940
- I'm a little more prone to seasickness.
- Ah, dehydration.

136
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,817
- You all right, boss?
- Yeah.

137
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,653
In that case, you're quite right.
The simpler the better.

138
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,238
Thanks so much.

139
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:22,117
Rachel still believes
the children are alive.

140
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,662
She also believes
this place is her home in the Berkshires.

141
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,041
- You're kidding me.
- She's never once in two years

142
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,835
acknowledged that she's
in an institution.

143
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:35,756
She believes we're all deliverymen,
milkmen, postal workers.

144
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,049
To sustain the delusion
that her children never died,

145
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,177
she's created
an elaborate fictional structure,

146
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:43,597
and she gives us all
parts to play in that fiction.

147
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,600
So have you searched the grounds yet?

148
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,269
The warden and his men
scoured the island.

149
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,854
Not a trace.

150
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:56,026
And what's more disturbing is we don't
know how she got out of her room.

151
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:59,863
It was locked from the outside,
and the only window is barred.

152
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:06,161
It's as if she evaporated
straight through the walls.

153
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,879
I brought her right back here
after group therapy, locked her in,

154
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,965
came back for midnight rounds,
she was gone.

155
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:29,976
Seriously, Doctor, how is it possible
that the truth never gets through to her?

156
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,979
I mean,
she's in a mental institution, right?

157
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,065
Seems like something you'd notice
from time to time.

158
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,317
How many pairs of shoes
are the patients given?

159
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,777
Two pairs.

160
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,114
Sanity's not a choice, Marshal.
You can't just choose to get over it.

161
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:47,077
So, she left here barefoot?

162
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,497
Come on, Doc,
she couldn't get 10 yards in that terrain.

163
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,166
Marshal?

164
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,187
This is definitely Rachel's handwriting.

165
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,107
I have no idea
what the law of four is, though.

166
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,068
- It's not a psychiatric term?
- I'm afraid not.

167
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,611
"Who is 67?"

168
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:23,947
Fuck if I know.

169
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,075
I have to say that's quite close
to my clinical conclusion.

170
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,870
Think it's just random scribblings?

171
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:33,707
Oh, no, not at all. Rachel's smart.
Brilliant, in fact.

172
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,250
This paper could be important.

173
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,169
Excuse me, Doctor,
but we're gonna have to hold on to this.

174
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,629
Of course.

175
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,467
And you say
she had to come through here?

176
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:48,805
After lights out,
the orderlies play cards in here.

177
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:52,183
Last night, there were seven men
sitting at the base of those stairs

178
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:53,727
playing stud poker.

179
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,855
Yet somehow,
Rachel managed to slip past them.

180
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,607
Why?

181
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,276
How? She turns invisible?

182
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,279
Doctor, we're gonna need access
to the personnel files

183
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,363
of all the medical staff.

184
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,283
The nurses, the guards, the orderlies,
anyone who was working then.

185
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,493
We'll take your request
under consideration.

186
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,830
This is not a request, Doctor.

187
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,416
This is a federal facility,
and a dangerous prisoner...

188
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,710
- Patient.
- ...patient

189
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,087
has escaped. Now, you will comply or...

190
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,506
All I can say is I'll see what I can do.

191
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:28,553
Doctor, we're gonna need to speak
with the staff. Do you understand?

192
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,847
I'll assemble them in the common room
after dinner.

193
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,224
<i>If you have any further questions,</i>

194
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:36,603
<i>feel free to join the deputy warden
in the search.</i>

195
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,575
It's 11 miles
to the nearest land

196
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,369
and the water's freezing.

197
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,538
Current was strong last night,
tide pushing in.

198
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,207
She'd have drowned
or been crushed on the rocks,

199
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,418
and her body would have
washed back up on shore.

200
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,633
What about those caves
down there? Have you checked them?

201
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,094
No way she could get there.

202
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,972
The bases of those cliffs
are covered in poison ivy,

203
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:16,101
live oak, sumac, a thousand plants
with thorns as big as my dick.

204
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:20,063
You said yourself, Marshal,
she's got no shoes.

205
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,071
All right, let's check the other side.

206
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,413
- What's that tower?
- It's an old lighthouse.

207
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,874
The guards already searched inside it.

208
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,004
What's in there? More patients?

209
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,214
Sewage treatment facility.

210
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:50,593
It's getting dark soon.
I'm calling this off for tonight.

211
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,220
Let's go, boys!

212
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,018
<i>You were on watch
on the landing, huh?</i>

213
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:01,521
Yeah. Couldn't nobody get in or out
of their room on that corridor

214
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,356
without me seeing.

215
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,153
Okay, Rachel Solando, who else
does she have to pass to get down here?

216
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,037
Me. Glen Miga.

217
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,873
Sir, I didn't see nothing.

218
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,292
And you were at your post all night?

219
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,711
Yeah, but I didn't see a thing.

220
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:27,922
Glen.

221
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:30,759
Glen.

222
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:35,346
Tell me the truth.

223
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:37,766
I...

224
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,062
I maybe went to the bathroom.

225
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,273
What? You breached protocol. Christ...

226
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,650
I wasn't gone more than a minute.

227
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,737
All right, look. Let's back up here.
Let's all just back up.

228
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,240
Miss Solando was put in her room
for lights out.

229
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:57,786
Does anyone here know
what she did before that?

230
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,537
Anyone?

231
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,122
Come on, anyone, anyone,

232
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,332
anyone, anyone.

233
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,460
She was in a group therapy session.

234
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:08,338
Huh. Anything unusual occur?

235
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,216
Define "unusual."

236
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:12,759
Excuse me?

237
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:17,222
This is a mental institution, Marshal,
for the criminally insane.

238
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,265
Usual isn't a big part of our day.

239
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,936
I will rephrase.

240
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:26,981
Did anything happen last night
during group therapy that was more,

241
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,526
let's say, I don't know,
memorable than...

242
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,361
- Normal?
- Exactly.

243
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,822
No. Sorry.

244
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,492
Did Miss Solando say anything
during group therapy?

245
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,662
She was worried about the rain.

246
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:42,997
And she hated the food here.

247
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:45,208
Complained constantly,

248
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,043
last night included.

249
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,548
So you were there.
Was there a doctor present?

250
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,968
Yes, Dr. Sheehan led the discussion.

251
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,428
Dr. Sheehan?

252
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,473
Yes, he was running the session.

253
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:05,770
He's Rachel's primary, the psychiatrist
who directly oversees her care.

254
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:06,896
Huh.

255
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,859
We're gonna need
to speak with Dr. Sheehan.

256
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,405
I'm afraid that won't be possible.
He left on the ferry this morning.

257
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,825
His vacation was already planned.
He'd been putting it off too long.

258
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:23,663
You're in a state of lockdown,
a dangerous patient has escaped,

259
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:27,917
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation?

260
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,253
Well, of course. He's a doctor.

261
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:38,344
Do you have the phone number
for where he's gone?

262
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,181
Hello? Hello?

263
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,935
Hello? Anybody there?

264
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,314
I'm sorry, sir, but it's all down.
All the lines.

265
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,274
The storm's hitting the mainland
like a hammer.

266
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,318
If you get it working,
come find me immediately.

267
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,862
The marshals need to make
an important call.

268
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,280
Yes, sir.

269
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,328
Hello? Hello?

270
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,496
I'm afraid I have
evening rounds in the wards,

271
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,334
but I'll be having drinks and a cigar
at my house around 9:00,

272
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,461
if you'd care to drop by.

273
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,796
Good. We can talk then, right?

274
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,259
We have been talking, Marshal.

275
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:38,029
Gotta say, I'm thinking
I got in the wrong line of public service.

276
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:41,574
It is a little overwhelming.
It was constructed during the Civil War,

277
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:44,911
the same time as the military fort
housing Ward C.

278
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,295
This is the original
commander's quarters.

279
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:57,924
When Uncle Sam got the bill,
the commander was court-martialed.

280
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,051
I can see why.

281
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,679
Nice music. Who is that? Brahms?

282
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:04,639
No.

283
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:16,192
- It's Mahler.
- Quite right, Marshal.

284
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,905
Forgive me, gentlemen.
My colleague, Dr Jeremiah Naehring.

285
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:32,500
<i>Quartet for Piano and Strings
in A minor.</i>

286
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,672
Your poison, gentlemen?

287
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:40,550
- Rye, if you got it.
- Soda and ice, please. Thanks.

288
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:45,388
Oh? You don't indulge in alcohol?
I'm surprised.

289
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:50,393
Isn't it common
for men in your profession to imbibe?

290
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,730
Common enough. And yours?

291
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:56,566
I'm sorry?

292
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:59,485
- Your profession, Doctor. Psychiatry.
- Yes.

293
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:01,904
I always heard it was overrun
with boozers and drunks.

294
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,908
Not that I've noticed.

295
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,870
What's that?
Iced tea in your glass, there?

296
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:14,625
Excellent, Marshal. You have
outstanding defense mechanisms.

297
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:19,505
You must be quite adept
at interrogations, hmm?

298
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,975
Men like you are my specialty,
you know?

299
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,353
Men of violence.

300
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:35,313
Now that's a hell of an assumption
to make.

301
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:38,107
No assumption. No, not at all.
You misunderstand me.

302
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:41,152
I said you are men of violence.

303
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:44,405
I'm not accusing you
of being violent men.

304
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:45,448
That's quite different.

305
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,368
No, please. Please. Edify us, Doctor.

306
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,081
You both served overseas, huh?

307
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,374
It's not much of a stretch, Doc.

308
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:57,960
For all you know,
we were both paper pushers over there.

309
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,504
No, you were not.

310
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:16,646
Since the schoolyard,

311
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:20,733
neither of you has ever walked away
from a physical conflict.

312
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,985
No, no, not because you enjoy it,

313
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:26,948
but because retreat isn't something
you consider an option.

314
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,866
We weren't raised to run, Doc.

315
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,370
Ah! Yes. "Raised."

316
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,499
And who raised you, Marshal?

317
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,167
Me?

318
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,003
- Wolves.
- Ah!

319
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,509
Very impressive defense mechanisms.

320
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:47,695
<i>Do you believe
in God, Marshal?</i>

321
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,828
No, I'm quite serious.

322
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:04,420
You ever seen a death camp, Doctor?

323
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:10,760
Huh?

324
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,812
His English really is very good.

325
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:24,732
You hit the consonants
a tad hard, though.

326
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,485
You're a German?

327
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,696
Is legal immigration a crime, Marshal?

328
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,199
Oh, I don't know, Doctor. You tell us.

329
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:38,704
Now, listen. We're gonna need
those files on Sheehan

330
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:40,623
and the rest of the staff as well.

331
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:43,793
No personnel files will
be released to you. Period.

332
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,963
- We're gonna need those files.
- Out of the question.

333
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,757
Bullshit, out of the question! Bullshit!

334
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,635
Just who the hell's in charge here,
anyway, huh?

335
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:56,222
Dr. Naehring acts as liaison
to our Board of Overseers.

336
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,474
He relayed your request,
and it's been refused.

337
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:01,894
Refused? They don't have the authority
to refuse, and neither do you, sir.

338
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:05,690
Marshal, continue your investigation
and we'll do all we can to help.

339
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,358
This investigation is over.

340
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,777
We're gonna file our reports
and we're gonna hand it over to...

341
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:12,321
- Hoover's boys.
- Hoover's boys. That's right.

342
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:16,158
We'll be taking the ferry back
in the morning. Come on, Chuck.

343
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,168
Nice night.

344
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:35,177
You'll be bunking
in the orderlies' quarters.

345
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:51,027
Hey, boss. We really packing it in?

346
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:52,820
Why?

347
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:57,658
I guess... I don't know,
I just never really quit anything before.

348
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,911
We haven't heard the truth
once yet, Chuck.

349
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:05,249
Listen, Rachel Solando didn't slip out
of a locked cell, barefoot,

350
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,542
without any help.

351
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,629
I think she had a lot of help.

352
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:12,923
Maybe Cawley's sitting up
in his mansion right now

353
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:15,301
rethinking his whole attitude.

354
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:19,847
- Maybe, in the morning, we'll be...
- You're bluffing?

355
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:22,099
I didn't say that.

356
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:43,162
I found a whole stack of these, Teddy.

357
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:46,332
Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?

358
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,086
I killed a lot of people in the war.

359
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,714
Is that why you drink?

360
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,052
Are you real?

361
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,262
No.

362
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,935
She's still here.

363
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:07,937
Who?

364
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,272
Rachel?

365
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,150
She never left.

366
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:30,668
Remember when we stayed in the cabin
in the summer, Teddy?

367
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,170
We were so happy.

368
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,007
She's here.

369
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,051
You can't leave.

370
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,733
I'm not gonna leave.

371
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,986
I love you so much.

372
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,909
I'm just bones in a box, Teddy.

373
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:05,035
No.

374
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:07,997
I am.

375
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,793
You have to wake up.

376
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,172
I won't go.

377
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,758
You're here.

378
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:24,555
I'm not. You have to face that.

379
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,226
But she is.

380
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:32,855
So is he.

381
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,150
Who?

382
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:39,987
Laeddis.

383
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,619
- I have to go.
- No.

384
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:51,373
No, please. Please.
I need to hold on to you.

385
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,710
- Just a little bit longer, please.
- Oh, God, Teddy.

386
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,796
You have to let me go.

387
00:29:58,214 --> 00:29:59,590
I can't.

388
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,374
Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit.

389
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:39,922
Doctor!

390
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,132
Doctor, Doctor.

391
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:45,261
We need to interview the patients who
were in Rachel's group therapy session.

392
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,263
I thought your investigation was finished.

393
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:50,266
Well, it's not like we could take the ferry.

394
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,310
Now, was Rachel receiving
any other treatments for her illnesses?

395
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:58,524
Do you know the state of the mental
health field these days, gentlemen?

396
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,776
No, not a clue, Doctor.

397
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,236
War.

398
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:05,072
The old school believes
in surgical intervention.

399
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:06,615
Psychosurgery.

400
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:09,660
Procedures like
the transorbital lobotomy.

401
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:14,123
Some say the patients
become reasonable, docile.

402
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,458
Others say they become zombies.

403
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,752
- And the new school?
- Psychopharmacology.

404
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,046
A new drug has just been approved
called Thorazine,

405
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:24,300
which relaxes psychotic patients,
you could say tames them.

406
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,718
And which school are you, Doctor?

407
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:30,347
Me? I have this radical idea that
if you treat a patient with respect,

408
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:34,560
listen to him, try and understand,
you just might reach him.

409
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,857
Come on, Marge. It's okay.

410
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,485
- These patients, huh?
- Even these.

411
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,988
What should be a last resort
is becoming a first response.

412
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,909
Give them a pill, put them in a corner,
it all goes away.

413
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:52,244
Rachel Solando was
on a combination of drugs

414
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:54,288
meant to keep her
from becoming violent,

415
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,416
but it was only intermittently effective.

416
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,168
The greatest obstacle to her recovery

417
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:02,171
was her refusal
to face what she had done.

418
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,173
"Was."

419
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:09,595
Is there a reason you keep referring
to your patient in the past tense, Doctor?

420
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:15,726
Look outside, Marshal.
Why do you think?

421
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,276
Next up is Peter Breene.

422
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,695
Assaulted his father's nurse
with broken glass.

423
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:30,366
Nurse survived,
but her face is permanently disfigured.

424
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:31,867
I can't wait.

425
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:38,123
She'd smile at me. She was so sweet,
but you could see it in her eyes.

426
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:41,585
She liked to be naked, to suck cock.

427
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,713
Okay, Mr. Breene.

428
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,759
And then she asked me
if she can have a glass of water?

429
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:52,012
Alone, in the kitchen,
like that's no big deal?

430
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:56,058
- Well, why was that a big deal?
- It was obvious.

431
00:32:56,141 --> 00:33:00,354
She wanted me to pull out my thing
so that she could laugh at it.

432
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,899
Mr. Breene.

433
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:08,070
We need to ask you
some questions, okay?

434
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:12,491
When I cut her, she screamed.

435
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,121
But she scared me.

436
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:21,417
- What did she expect?
- Interesting.

437
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:26,088
But we're here
to talk about Rachel Solando, okay?

438
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,173
Rachel Solando. Do you...

439
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:30,509
Do you know that
she drowned her own kids?

440
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,761
She drowned her kids!

441
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:35,889
This is... This is a sick fucking world
we live in, I'll tell you that.

442
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,683
But you know what?
They should be gassed.

443
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:42,062
All of them.
The retards, the killers, the niggers.

444
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:44,773
You kill your own kid, gas the bitch.

445
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,945
Could you stop that?

446
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,907
- That nurse...
- Please, stop that.

447
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:57,036
That nurse, maybe she had kids, huh?

448
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,372
A husband.

449
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,834
Just trying to make ends meet,

450
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,504
lead a normal life.

451
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,758
It says in your file that

452
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,303
you tore her face off. Didn't you?

453
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:16,805
Congratulations.

454
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:19,767
No more normal for her,
not ever again. No.

455
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:24,229
Do you know what she was afraid of?

456
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:28,067
You.

457
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,402
Could you stop that? Please?

458
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,781
Stop that!

459
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,116
Please! Stop!

460
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:38,327
Do you know a patient
named Andrew Laeddis? Do you?

461
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,661
No! No.

462
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,789
- Boss. What's up?
- Fine.

463
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,832
- I wanna go back. I wanna go.
- Peter!

464
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:47,544
Come on! I got him. Peter! Peter!
Hey, Peter!

465
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:50,422
- Go back. I wanna go back.
- Come on, Peter.

466
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:51,673
- I don't wanna see him.
- Easy now.

467
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:54,510
- I don't wanna see him anymore.
- It's okay. It's all right.

468
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:04,353
Oh, I'll never get out of here.
I'm not sure that I should.

469
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,690
Excuse me for saying this,
Miss Kearns...

470
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,527
- Mrs.
- Mrs. Kearns.

471
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:16,115
But you seem quite normal.

472
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:19,409
I mean, in comparison
to the other patients here.

473
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:23,122
Well, I have my dark days.
I suppose everybody does.

474
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:27,918
The difference is most people
don't kill their husbands with an ax.

475
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,753
Ah.

476
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,673
Although, personally,
I think if a man beats you

477
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:37,553
and fucks half the women he sees,
and no one will help you,

478
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:42,057
axing him isn't the least
understandable thing you could do.

479
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:44,852
Maybe you shouldn't get out.

480
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:51,024
What would I do if I did?
I don't know the world anymore.

481
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:55,779
They say there are bombs
that can reduce whole cities to ash.

482
00:35:55,863 --> 00:36:01,201
And what do you call them, televisions,
voices and faces coming from a box.

483
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,871
I hear enough voices already.

484
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:07,583
What can you tell us about Rachel?

485
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:10,294
Um...

486
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,672
Not much. She keeps to herself.

487
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:17,176
She believed her kids were alive.

488
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,304
She thought she was still living
in the Berkshires,

489
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:25,350
and we were all her neighbors,
the milkmen, postmen...

490
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:26,977
Deliverymen.

491
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,606
And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?

492
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:34,276
Yes. He talked about anger.

493
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:40,240
Tell me about him. What's he like?

494
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,744
Uh, he's, uh...

495
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:48,123
Okay. Nice.

496
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:51,960
Not hard on the eyes,
as my mother would say.

497
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:58,175
- Did he ever make a pass at you?
- No.

498
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:02,638
No, Dr. Sheehan's a good doctor,
he would never...

499
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:05,349
Um...

500
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,310
Could I have
a glass of water, please?

501
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,811
No problem.

502
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,995
- Thank you, Marshal.
- Sure.

503
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:34,086
I just have one more question
for you, Mrs. Kearns.

504
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:40,634
Did you ever meet a patient
named Andrew Laeddis?

505
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,888
No.

506
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:47,933
Never heard of him.

507
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,023
<i>She was coached.</i>

508
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,193
She used practically the same words
as Cawley and the nurse,

509
00:37:58,277 --> 00:38:01,697
- like she'd been told exactly what to say.
- Who's Andrew Laeddis?

510
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:10,622
You asked every one of those patients
back there about him. Who is he?

511
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,921
What the hell, boss?
I'm your partner, for Christ's sake.

512
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:19,881
We just met, Chuck.

513
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:23,885
You've been on the beat for a long time.
You've got a duty. You've got a career.

514
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:28,390
What I'm doing,
it's not exactly by the book.

515
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,602
I don't give a damn
about by-the-book, boss.

516
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:35,564
I just wanna know
what the hell's going on.

517
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,446
When this case came over the wires,

518
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:46,325
I requested it specifically,
you understand?

519
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:47,951
Why?

520
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,913
Andrew Laeddis,

521
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:54,916
he was the maintenance man
in the apartment building

522
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,169
where my wife and I lived.

523
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,463
Okay.

524
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:03,342
He was also a firebug.

525
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:08,764
Andrew Laeddis lit the match

526
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:14,436
that caused the fire that killed my wife.

527
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:24,112
Let them out!

528
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:30,118
- What happened to Laeddis?
- He got away with it.

529
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:32,621
Laeddis got away with it
and then he disappeared.

530
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,749
About a year ago, I open up the paper
and there he is.

531
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:40,295
Ugly-looking son of a bitch. Huge scar
from his right temple down to his left lip.

532
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:43,840
Eyes different colors.
Not the type of face you'd forget.

533
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:47,052
He burned down a schoolhouse,
killed two people,

534
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,887
said voices told him to do it.

535
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,640
First he went to prison,
then he got transferred here.

536
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,934
- Then what?
- Then nothing.

537
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:57,771
He vanished like he never existed.
No record whatsoever.

538
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:00,190
Pretty sure he's not in Ward B.
That leaves Ward C.

539
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:01,566
Or he could be dead.

540
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:04,277
So could Rachel Solando,
for that matter.

541
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,905
Lot of places to hide a body here.

542
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:10,617
Only one place
no one would really notice.

543
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:26,258
That patient, Bridget Kearns,
when she sent me for water,

544
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:29,261
she said something to you back there,
didn't she?

545
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,470
No.

546
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:33,682
Come on, boss.

547
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:39,104
She wrote it.

548
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:59,666
Boss! We gotta get indoors. It's turning
into a fucking Kansas out here.

549
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,960
- Hold on.
- No, let's go!

550
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:06,298
Watch out!

551
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,634
Jesus!

552
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,680
- Come on! Up there!
- Let's go!

553
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,310
Get in there! Let's go!

554
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,148
Boss!

555
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,282
- God!
- Jesus Christ!

556
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:35,577
Damn it. God!

557
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:47,547
- You okay, boss?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

558
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,640
So if Laeddis is here,

559
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,101
- what are you gonna do about it?
- Mmm.

560
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:04,147
I'm not here to kill Laeddis.

561
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:14,658
If it was my wife, I'd kill him. Twice.

562
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:30,048
<i>When we got through the gates
at Dachau, the SS guards surrendered.</i>

563
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:44,312
The <i>Kommandant</i> tried to kill himself
before we got there, but he...

564
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,773
<i>He botched it.</i>

565
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,318
Took him an hour to die.

566
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,160
When I went outside,
I saw all the bodies on the ground.

567
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,333
<i>Too many to count.</i>

568
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:33,862
Too many to imagine.

569
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:38,199
So, yeah, the...

570
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,329
The guards surrendered,
we took their guns,

571
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,289
<i>and we lined them up.</i>

572
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,627
It wasn't warfare. It was...

573
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:34,172
It was murder.

574
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:40,595
Yeah, I've had enough of killing.

575
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:45,100
That's not why I'm here.

576
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,978
So what is this all about?

577
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:56,111
After Laeddis vanished, I started doing
some checking on Ashecliffe.

578
00:44:57,612 --> 00:45:00,699
A lot of people know about this place,
but no one wants to talk.

579
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:02,283
You know, it's like it...

580
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:04,828
It's like they're scared or something.

581
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:09,874
You know, this place is funded
by a special grant

582
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:13,628
from The House
Un-American Activities Committee?

583
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:16,881
HUAC? And how exactly
are we fighting the communists

584
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:19,300
from an island in Boston Harbor?

585
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:22,554
By conducting experiments on the mind.

586
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:25,473
At least that's my guess.

587
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:27,267
And you think that's going on here?

588
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:29,811
Like I said, no one would talk, right?

589
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:32,605
Till I found somebody
who used to be a patient here.

590
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:37,026
Guy's name is George Noyce.
Nice college kid. Socialist.

591
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,154
He gets offered some money
to do a psych study.

592
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:40,655
Guess what they were testing?

593
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:41,823
Toothpaste.

594
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:44,284
So, he starts
seeing dragons everywhere.

595
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:49,330
He almost beats his professor to death.
Ends up here in Ashecliffe, Ward C.

596
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:53,501
They release him after one year, right?
And what does he do?

597
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:58,465
Two weeks on the mainland, he walks
into a bar, stabs three men to death.

598
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:04,012
His lawyer pleads insanity, but Noyce,
he stands up in the courtroom and he...

599
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:08,516
He begs the judge for the electric chair.
Anywhere but a mental hospital.

600
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:11,728
Judge gives him life in Dedham Prison.

601
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:15,565
- And you found him.
- Yeah, I found him.

602
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:18,151
Well, he's a mess.

603
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:21,863
But it's pretty clear
from what he tells me.

604
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:23,072
What?

605
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:25,200
They're experimenting on people here.

606
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,702
I don't know, boss.

607
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:32,248
- How do you believe a crazy guy?
- That's the beauty of it, isn't it?

608
00:46:32,332 --> 00:46:36,586
Crazy people, they're the perfect
subjects. They talk, nobody listens.

609
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,838
I stood at Dachau.

610
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:43,760
We saw what human beings are capable
of doing to each other, right?

611
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:46,429
For Christ's sakes, we fought
a goddamn war to stop them,

612
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:51,392
and now... Now I find out it may be
happening here? On our soil? No.

613
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,188
So what are you really here to do, Ted?

614
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:59,734
I'm gonna get the proof,
I'm gonna go back,

615
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:02,028
and I'm gonna blow the lid off this place.

616
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,072
That's it.

617
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:06,366
Wait a minute.

618
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:09,744
You started asking around
about Ashecliffe,

619
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:11,246
waiting for a chance to get out here,

620
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,915
and then suddenly
they need a U.S. Marshal?

621
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:17,919
Yeah, I got lucky. There was a patient
escape. It was the perfect excuse.

622
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:20,964
No, no, no, boss.
Luck doesn't work that way.

623
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:22,757
The world doesn't work that way.

624
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:26,094
They got an electrified fence
around a septic facility.

625
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:29,305
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

626
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:33,101
A Chief of Staff with ties to the OSS?
Funding from HUAC?

627
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:37,772
I mean, Jesus Christ, everything about
this place stinks of government ops.

628
00:47:37,814 --> 00:47:39,816
- What if they wanted you here?
- Bullshit.

629
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:42,026
- You were asking questions.
- Bullshit! Bullshit!

630
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:43,611
Bullshit. We came here
for Rachel Solando.

631
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:46,614
Where's one shred of evidence
she even existed?

632
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:47,824
There's no way they could've known

633
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,284
I'd be assigned to this case.
There's no way.

634
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:52,745
What if while you were looking into
them, they were looking into you?

635
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:55,999
All they had to do was fake an escape
to get you here, and now they have you.

636
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:57,876
Now they have us both. Here! Now!

637
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,465
<i>Marshals, are you out here?</i>

638
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:06,885
<i>This is Deputy Warden McPherson.</i>

639
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:08,636
<i>Marshals!</i>

640
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,722
How about that? They found us, huh?

641
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,308
It's an island, boss.
They're always gonna find us.

642
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:16,311
<i>I know you're in there.</i>

643
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:21,065
We're getting off this goddamn island.
You and me. Come on.

644
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:27,488
- Come on!
- Go, go!

645
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:40,418
Get dried off.
Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you now.

646
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:44,589
And hurry up! This thing is turning
into a goddamn hurricane!

647
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:54,098
I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.
Should be ready by tomorrow.

648
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:57,018
That is, if we all don't wash away first.

649
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:01,522
You know, speaking of which, I'm afraid
your smokes are pretty much done for.

650
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:03,274
So...

651
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:07,070
This is our only choice, huh?

652
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:10,198
Got something really nice in
a prison gray if that don't work for you.

653
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:13,201
Now that you mention it,
these are just fine.

654
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:17,038
That's why I must repeat my insistence
that all Ward C patients

655
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,374
be placed in manual restraints.

656
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:22,752
If the facility floods, they'll drown.
You know that.

657
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:24,462
That would take
a lot of flooding.

658
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:25,546
We're on an island

659
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:27,215
in the middle of the ocean
during a hurricane.

660
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,968
A lot of flooding seems
like a distinct possibility.

661
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:32,387
It's a gamble, Stephen.
Say the power fails.

662
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,721
There's a backup generator.

663
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:36,516
And if that goes,
the cell doors will open.

664
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,311
Where are they going to go? Mmm?

665
00:49:40,395 --> 00:49:43,398
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over
to the mainland and wreak havoc.

666
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:44,524
Oh, you're quite right.

667
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:47,735
They're far more likely
to wreak havoc right here on us.

668
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:51,572
If they're manacled to the floor,
they'll die.

669
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,783
This is 24 human beings.

670
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:55,743
And you can live with that, can you?

671
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,914
Well, frankly, if it were up to me,
I'd put all 42 in Wards A and B

672
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:01,374
in manual restraints as well.

673
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:04,293
- Excuse me! Excuse me.
- Marshal.

674
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:06,921
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I just have one quick question.

675
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:08,256
Yes, I'll be with you in a moment.

676
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:11,300
When we spoke this morning
about Rachel Solando's note...

677
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:13,094
"The law of four." I love that.

678
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:16,723
...you said you had no idea what that
second line could refer to, correct?

679
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:22,145
"Who is 67?" Yes, I'm afraid I still don't.
None of us do.

680
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:24,897
Uh-huh. Nothing comes to mind?

681
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:28,818
Nothing?

682
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:37,827
Because I believe I just heard you say
there are 24 patients in Ward C

683
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:40,413
and 42 patients in Wards A and B,

684
00:50:40,455 --> 00:50:43,916
which means there's a total of,
what, 66 patients at this facility?

685
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:46,586
That is correct, yes.

686
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:52,467
Well, it seems to me
Rachel Solando was suggesting

687
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:56,345
that you have a 67th patient, Doctor.

688
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:59,348
But I'm afraid we don't.

689
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:01,934
This is ridiculous.
What are they doing here?

690
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,145
We're doing our goddamn job.

691
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:07,148
Didn't McPherson tell you
the good news?

692
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,151
No.
What's the good news, Doctor?

693
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,570
Rachel's been found.

694
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:14,989
She's here.

695
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:17,658
Safe and sound.

696
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:31,380
There's not a mark on her.

697
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,427
Who are these men?

698
00:51:39,806 --> 00:51:41,390
Why are they in my house?

699
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:45,978
Police officers, Rachel.
They have a few questions.

700
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:50,691
Ma'am.

701
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:58,699
There has been a sighting of a known
communist subversive in this area,

702
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,660
passing out literature.

703
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,663
Here?

704
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,542
In this neighborhood?

705
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,335
Yes, I'm afraid so.

706
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:14,298
Now if you could tell us what you did
yesterday, where you were,

707
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:16,509
it would really help us
narrow down our search.

708
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:19,387
Yes, um...

709
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,474
Well, I, um...

710
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:29,230
I made breakfast
for Jim and the children,

711
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,316
and then I

712
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:36,404
packed Jim's lunch and he left.

713
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:42,743
Then I sent the children off to school.

714
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:48,416
And then

715
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:57,884
I decided to take a long swim
in the lake.

716
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:05,975
I see.

717
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,230
And after that?

718
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,486
Um...

719
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:20,740
After that,

720
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,168
I thought of you.

721
00:53:38,174 --> 00:53:42,136
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I don't know what you're talking about.

722
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:48,100
Don't you know
how lonely I've been, Jim?

723
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:55,149
You're gone.

724
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:00,863
You're dead.

725
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,787
I cry every night.

726
00:54:13,793 --> 00:54:16,003
How am I supposed to survive?

727
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:18,673
God.

728
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:32,353
Rachel, it'll be all right.

729
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,650
I'm so sorry, but every...

730
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,196
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay?

731
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:45,574
I buried you.

732
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,538
I buried an empty casket.
Your body rained down,

733
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:54,125
lumps of flesh splashing into the sea,
eaten by sharks.

734
00:54:58,379 --> 00:55:01,007
My Jim's dead, so who the fuck are you?

735
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:06,095
Who the fuck are you?

736
00:55:06,846 --> 00:55:07,972
- Who are you?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

737
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,682
- Who are you?
- It's okay. Rachel. Rachel, it's all right.

738
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:12,226
Let me go! No!

739
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:16,022
- Rachel, it's okay.
- Look at me, look at me.

740
00:55:19,317 --> 00:55:22,236
I'm sorry about that.
I didn't want to interrupt.

741
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,655
I thought she might tell you something.

742
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:28,701
We found her down by the lighthouse,
skipping stones.

743
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:30,911
We've no idea how she got out, but...

744
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:33,414
I'm gonna have to ask you
to go down into the basement.

745
00:55:33,456 --> 00:55:35,416
There's food, water and cots.

746
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:38,753
It's the safest place to be
when the hurricane hits.

747
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:45,259
Are you all right? You look pale.

748
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:47,136
I'm fine. It's just...

749
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:50,181
Boss, are you okay?

750
00:55:51,182 --> 00:55:53,768
It's just so goddamn bright, isn't it?

751
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:58,230
Photosensitivity, headaches sometimes.
Marshal, are you having a migraine?

752
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,940
I'll be all right.

753
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:04,278
Come on, I got you.

754
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:07,698
What's wrong with him?

755
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:10,201
Take these, Marshal. Couple of hours,
you'll be as clear as a bell.

756
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:12,286
- What's wrong with him?
- He's having a migraine.

757
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:14,663
Imagine someone sawed open
your head, filled it with razors,

758
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:17,458
and shook it as hard as they could.
Take the pills, Marshal.

759
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:19,668
- I don't... I don't want the pills.
- It'll stop the pain.

760
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:21,670
Marshal, take the pills.

761
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,635
He's going to need to lie down.

762
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:34,308
Oh, my God!

763
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:35,684
There's broken glass
all over the floor.

764
00:56:35,768 --> 00:56:37,311
- Make sure all the meds are locked up.
- Watch your back.

765
00:56:37,353 --> 00:56:38,479
Make sure everything's okay
in Ward B.

766
00:56:38,521 --> 00:56:39,814
Go down
to the infirmary and see

767
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,232
- if there's any more...
- All right, Doctor.

768
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:45,152
Give him a bed. This one here.

769
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:48,823
- Over here. All right, boss.
- Yeah, that's it.

770
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:49,990
- You have him?
- Yes.

771
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:52,118
Careful. All right.

772
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:55,830
Could be worse right now.
He'll be all right.

773
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:03,629
Who is that?

774
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:06,173
Him? That's the warden.

775
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:13,139
Don't you worry about him, all right?
Come on. Lay back. Lay back.

776
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:20,688
He looks like an ex-military prick, huh?

777
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:22,690
Well, you know what?
I ain't gonna argue with you on that one.

778
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:51,445
You should have saved me.

779
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:55,741
You should have saved all of us.

780
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:26,730
Hey, buddy.

781
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:30,025
Hey.

782
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:31,402
Laeddis.

783
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:34,196
Yeah.

784
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:40,578
My...

785
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:46,166
My buddy.

786
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:49,628
No hard feelings, right?

787
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:54,633
Yeah.

788
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:57,845
No hard feelings.

789
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:13,485
A little something for later,

790
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:19,575
'cause I know how much you need it.

791
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:29,835
The clock's ticking, my friend.
We're running out of time.

792
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,431
Give me a hand here.

793
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:06,205
I could get into trouble.

794
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:35,943
I'm dead.

795
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:40,447
I'm so sorry.

796
01:01:42,116 --> 01:01:44,118
Why didn't you save me?

797
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:50,749
I tried. I wanted to, but by the time
I got there, it was too late.

798
01:02:12,855 --> 01:02:13,981
See?

799
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:19,153
Aren't they beautiful?

800
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:16,001
Why are you all wet, baby?

801
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:20,380
Laeddis isn't dead.

802
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:23,258
He isn't gone.

803
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:26,053
He's still here.

804
01:03:28,347 --> 01:03:29,556
I know.

805
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:32,017
You need to find him, Teddy.

806
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:34,728
You need to find him
and you kill him dead.

807
01:03:51,954 --> 01:03:53,872
It's okay.

808
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:06,677
- Security to Ward A. Okay.
- Ward A. I got it.

809
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,762
The generator room's flooded.

810
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:11,098
- Ward A. Ward A.
- See what we need in Ward B.

811
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:12,683
Let's go.

812
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:14,560
You okay, boss?

813
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:19,231
This goddamn migraine.

814
01:04:19,273 --> 01:04:23,151
The backup generator's failed.
The whole place has gone crazy.

815
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:26,154
What do you want to do?

816
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:35,539
- Christ.
- Dan? Relax. Nope, nope, nope.

817
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:38,083
You don't wanna do that. Put it down.
Now. Put it down.

818
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:41,712
Grab him, grab him, grab him, grab him!
Get him, get him!

819
01:04:45,716 --> 01:04:48,802
You need to go find him
'cause he needs to be here.

820
01:04:48,844 --> 01:04:51,388
You think the whole electrical system
is fried?

821
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:54,224
I'd say it's a good possibility, yeah.

822
01:04:54,308 --> 01:04:57,352
- All the electronic security, the fences...
- Why are you always running?

823
01:04:57,436 --> 01:05:00,647
- ...the gates, the doors.
- Why is it you every time? Come on.

824
01:05:00,689 --> 01:05:04,651
Nice day for a stroll, don't you think?
To Ward C, for example.

825
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:10,324
- Come on.
- Maybe we'll run into Andrew Laeddis.

826
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:18,332
The guy I told you about,
George Noyce?

827
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:21,084
He told me this is where
they keep the worst ones.

828
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:23,795
Guys even the other inmates
are scared of.

829
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:28,008
Did Noyce give you anything
on the layout?

830
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:31,845
Not really. All he remembered was
people screaming day and night,

831
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:34,598
no windows and iron bars everywhere.

832
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:35,849
Watch your head!

833
01:05:56,161 --> 01:05:58,163
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- Jesus.

834
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,499
First time on Ward C, huh?

835
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,251
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

836
01:06:03,335 --> 01:06:04,378
We heard stories, but...

837
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:07,089
Trust me, son, you haven't heard shit.

838
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:09,716
We got most of the bugsies
locked down now,

839
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:12,010
but some of them are still loose.

840
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:14,763
And if you see one,
don't try to restrain him yourselves.

841
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:17,224
These fuckers will kill you. Clear?

842
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:21,228
All right, get your asses moving then.
Go on.

843
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:19,286
He's here.

844
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:26,710
Laeddis. I can feel him.

845
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,758
Tag! You're it!

846
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,801
Wait! Boss! Ted!

847
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:46,021
Hey! Hey!

848
01:07:47,481 --> 01:07:48,648
Teddy.

849
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,067
Listen to me.

850
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:36,071
Listen, I don't wanna leave here,
all right?

851
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:38,740
I mean, why would anybody want to?

852
01:08:38,824 --> 01:08:42,327
We hear things here
about the outside world.

853
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:45,831
- About atolls, about H-bomb tests.
- Teddy, where are you?

854
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:47,874
You know how a hydrogen bomb works?

855
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:51,211
- I know. With hydrogen! With hydrogen.
- Ah, that's funny.

856
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:54,214
- Boss!
- Other bombs explode, right?

857
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:56,675
But not the hydrogen bomb.

858
01:08:56,716 --> 01:09:02,180
It implodes, creating an explosion
to the thousandth, the millionth degree!

859
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,266
- Do you get it?
- Yeah! Yeah.

860
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:05,934
- Do you?
- I get it, I get it!

861
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:07,269
Let him go!

862
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:11,982
No!

863
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:23,243
No! No!

864
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,413
What are you doing?

865
01:09:26,705 --> 01:09:29,416
Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!

866
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:31,001
Oh, you got Billings.

867
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:33,587
What the fuck's
the matter with you guys?

868
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:34,754
Catch them, not kill them!

869
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:37,799
- He jumped us.
- You, give me a hand with him.

870
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:40,302
We've gotta get him to the infirmary.
God damn it.

871
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:42,971
No, no! Not you, not you. Take a walk.

872
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:47,100
Come on. Cawley's gonna have
my goddamn balls for this.

873
01:10:18,048 --> 01:10:20,258
Laeddis.

874
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:42,072
Laeddis.

875
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:55,710
Stop me, please,

876
01:10:55,794 --> 01:10:57,337
before I kill more.

877
01:10:59,339 --> 01:11:01,841
Stop me before I kill more.

878
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:04,177
Laeddis.

879
01:11:12,269 --> 01:11:14,187
Please, please.

880
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:20,402
I see you all.

881
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:24,531
Laeddis.

882
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,623
You told me I'd be free of this place.

883
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:36,626
You promised.

884
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:39,671
You lied.

885
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:41,548
Laeddis.

886
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:48,388
Laeddis?

887
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:51,433
That's pretty damn funny.

888
01:11:53,852 --> 01:11:56,396
- Your voice.
- Don't you recognize it?

889
01:11:57,689 --> 01:11:59,816
After all the talks we had?

890
01:12:00,734 --> 01:12:02,777
After all the lies you told me?

891
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:04,654
Let me see your face.

892
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:07,115
They say I'm theirs now.

893
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:10,577
They say I'll never leave here.

894
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:13,997
Your match is about to go out.

895
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:19,336
- Let me see your goddamn face! Now!
- Why?

896
01:12:19,753 --> 01:12:21,212
So you can lie to me more?

897
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:24,299
- This isn't about the truth.
- Yes, it is.

898
01:12:24,466 --> 01:12:27,969
- It's about exposing the truth.
- It's about you!

899
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:29,763
And Laeddis.

900
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:33,058
That's all it's ever been about.

901
01:12:34,142 --> 01:12:37,854
I was incidental. A way in.

902
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:43,860
George... George Noyce.

903
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:48,490
No. It's not possible. You can't be here.

904
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:49,949
You like it?

905
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:53,620
Who did this to you, George?

906
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:54,913
You did.

907
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:56,915
What the hell do you mean?

908
01:12:56,956 --> 01:13:01,127
All your talk. All your fucking talk,
and I'm back in here because of you.

909
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:03,797
George, how did they get you
out of Dedham, huh?

910
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,090
However this happened, I...

911
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:07,133
I'm gonna find a way to fix this,
you understand me?

912
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:11,096
I'll never get out now. I got out once.
Not twice, never twice.

913
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:13,014
Just tell me how they got you here.

914
01:13:13,098 --> 01:13:15,809
They knew! Don't you get it?

915
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:19,270
Everything you were up to.
Your whole plan.

916
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:23,733
This is a game. All of this is for you.

917
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:28,905
You're not investigating anything.
You're a fucking rat in a maze.

918
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:31,491
Georgie...

919
01:13:32,117 --> 01:13:35,245
- George, you're wrong. You're wrong.
- Oh, really?

920
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:38,331
Been alone much since you got here?

921
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:41,668
I've been with my partner.

922
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,087
You never worked with him before,
have you?

923
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:48,883
He's a U.S. Marshal. He's...

924
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:51,803
You never worked
with him before, have you?

925
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:58,476
George, look, I know people.
I trust this man.

926
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,442
Then they've already won.

927
01:14:08,403 --> 01:14:09,529
Fuck.

928
01:14:14,284 --> 01:14:17,328
And they're gonna take me
to the lighthouse.

929
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,790
They're gonna cut into my brain.

930
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,877
And I'm only here

931
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:25,545
because of you!

932
01:14:26,588 --> 01:14:28,965
George, I'm gonna get you out of here.

933
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:31,342
You're not going to the lighthouse.
You're not.

934
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,179
You can't dig out the truth
and kill Laeddis at the same time.

935
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:37,807
You gotta make a choice.
You understand that, don't you?

936
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:41,227
- I'm not here to kill anyone.
- Liar!

937
01:14:41,311 --> 01:14:44,397
I'm not gonna kill him, I swear to you!
I swear.

938
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:46,024
She's dead.

939
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:48,735
She... Let her go.

940
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:51,613
Let her go.

941
01:14:52,614 --> 01:14:55,867
Tell him, Teddy.
Tell him why.

942
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:01,247
You gotta do it.
There's no other way.

943
01:15:01,873 --> 01:15:03,416
- Let her go.
- Tell him about the day

944
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:06,336
- you brought me my locket.
- You gotta do it!

945
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:09,839
How I told you my heart was breaking
and you asked me why.

946
01:15:09,923 --> 01:15:12,800
She's fucking with your head.

947
01:15:12,884 --> 01:15:14,761
And I told you it was from happiness.

948
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,305
She's gonna kill you.
She's gonna kill you.

949
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:23,603
You wanna uncover the truth?
You gotta let her go.

950
01:15:25,772 --> 01:15:27,440
- I can't.
- You have to let her go!

951
01:15:27,524 --> 01:15:29,400
I can't! I can't.

952
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:38,826
Then you'll never leave this island.

953
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:45,792
Dolores.

954
01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:54,425
He's not in this ward.

955
01:15:56,636 --> 01:15:59,639
He was transferred out of here.

956
01:16:01,808 --> 01:16:06,646
If he's not in Ward A,
there's only one place he can be.

957
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:14,070
The lighthouse.

958
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:22,495
Hey,

959
01:16:24,998 --> 01:16:26,499
God help you.

960
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:36,593
Boss, we got problems.

961
01:16:36,676 --> 01:16:39,262
McPherson and Cawley
are in the building.

962
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:41,097
They heard an orderly went batshit
on a patient.

963
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:44,058
They're looking all over the place for
him and they're on their way to the roof.

964
01:16:44,142 --> 01:16:46,019
Let's get the hell out of here. This way.

965
01:16:49,022 --> 01:16:51,357
Just keep going. We belong here.

966
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,036
What happened to you?

967
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:04,704
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

968
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:06,623
where were you?

969
01:17:06,998 --> 01:17:11,753
After we got that guy to the infirmary,
I took a little detour to patient records.

970
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:14,005
Did you ever find Laeddis?

971
01:17:14,047 --> 01:17:15,965
No. No, I never found him.

972
01:17:16,049 --> 01:17:19,010
Well, I got the next best thing.
His intake form.

973
01:17:19,052 --> 01:17:21,220
It was the only thing in his files.
There's no session notes,

974
01:17:21,262 --> 01:17:25,016
no incident reports, no photographs,
just this. It was weird.

975
01:17:25,058 --> 01:17:26,726
Here. Take a look.

976
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,895
I'll look at it later.

977
01:17:30,897 --> 01:17:32,190
What's the matter, boss?

978
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:35,568
I'll look it over later, that's all.

979
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:40,907
- Ashecliffe's that way.
- I'm not going to Ashecliffe.

980
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:44,410
I'm going to that lighthouse.

981
01:17:44,452 --> 01:17:46,788
I'm gonna find out what the fuck
is happening on this island.

982
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:02,345
There it is.

983
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:07,225
Damn. We're too far south.
We're gonna have to double back.

984
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:09,477
There's no way we could cross
those rocks.

985
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,270
There could be a way
behind those trees.

986
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:14,440
Maybe a path that goes around the
rocks and leads over to the lighthouse.

987
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:15,566
- Boss...
- Come on.

988
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:17,985
Wait, wait, what are we doing?
We got the intake form.

989
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:19,862
It's proof there's a 67th patient,

990
01:18:19,946 --> 01:18:22,782
which they said, repeatedly,
doesn't exist.

991
01:18:23,241 --> 01:18:26,452
I'm getting to that lighthouse.
You understand?

992
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:30,498
What the hell can I say to you
to stop you?

993
01:18:30,581 --> 01:18:32,917
Why would you want to, Chuck? Why?

994
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,794
Because climbing down there
when it's dark

995
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:38,047
is a thin step short of suicide,
that's why.

996
01:18:38,131 --> 01:18:41,551
Okay, maybe you better
sit this one out then.

997
01:18:43,136 --> 01:18:45,138
You brought me into this, boss,

998
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:48,558
and now we're trapped here on this rock,
on this island,

999
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:50,184
with no one to rely on but each other,

1000
01:18:50,268 --> 01:18:53,730
- and now you're acting like...
- Like what? Like what?

1001
01:18:54,355 --> 01:18:55,857
How am I acting?

1002
01:19:00,153 --> 01:19:03,614
What the hell happened back there
in those cells, Ted?

1003
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:11,080
What do you think the weather's like
in Portland, Chuck?

1004
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:13,332
I'm from Seattle.

1005
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,211
Seattle.

1006
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:21,674
I'm going on

1007
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:23,718
alone.

1008
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:28,973
- I'm going with you, boss.
- I said alone.

1009
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:31,809
Fine.

1010
01:19:58,461 --> 01:19:59,712
Damn it!

1011
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:02,006
Damn it.

1012
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:10,097
I knew it wouldn't take long,
but I couldn't get to it.

1013
01:20:10,181 --> 01:20:11,724
The tide was up.

1014
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:21,108
Chuck!

1015
01:20:23,653 --> 01:20:24,821
Chuck!

1016
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:27,633
Come on!

1017
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:04,170
Chuck!

1018
01:22:04,754 --> 01:22:06,672
Where are you, Chuck?

1019
01:22:31,322 --> 01:22:32,531
Chuck!

1020
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:35,409
Chuck!

1021
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:21,288
Who are you?

1022
01:23:23,416 --> 01:23:26,252
I'm Teddy Daniels. I'm a cop.

1023
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:29,338
You're the marshal.

1024
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:31,966
That's right.

1025
01:23:34,135 --> 01:23:38,055
Would you mind taking your hand
from behind your back, please?

1026
01:23:38,097 --> 01:23:39,932
Why? Why?

1027
01:23:41,434 --> 01:23:44,437
I wanna make sure that
what you're holding won't hurt me.

1028
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:53,821
I'm gonna keep this

1029
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:56,824
if you don't mind.

1030
01:23:57,658 --> 01:23:59,076
Fine by me.

1031
01:24:08,127 --> 01:24:09,462
You're...

1032
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,715
You're Rachel Solando.

1033
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:15,718
The real one.

1034
01:24:19,722 --> 01:24:21,348
Did you kill your children?

1035
01:24:23,142 --> 01:24:24,977
I never had children.

1036
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:27,438
I was never married.

1037
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:32,526
And before I was a patient at Ashecliffe,
I worked here.

1038
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,738
You... You were a nurse?

1039
01:24:38,074 --> 01:24:40,034
I was a doctor, Marshal.

1040
01:24:43,454 --> 01:24:45,164
You think I'm crazy.

1041
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:48,876
- No. No, no, I never...
- And if I say I'm not crazy?

1042
01:24:50,086 --> 01:24:52,505
Well, that hardly helps, does it?

1043
01:24:53,339 --> 01:24:55,841
That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.

1044
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:01,430
People tell the world you're crazy,

1045
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:05,434
and all your protests to the contrary
just confirm what they're saying.

1046
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:09,188
I'm not following you. I'm sorry.

1047
01:25:09,814 --> 01:25:11,816
Once you're declared insane,

1048
01:25:11,857 --> 01:25:15,361
then anything you do is called
part of that insanity.

1049
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:21,033
Reasonable protests are denial.
Valid fears, paranoia.

1050
01:25:21,117 --> 01:25:22,701
Survival instincts are

1051
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:25,162
defense mechanisms.

1052
01:25:25,496 --> 01:25:29,208
You're smarter than you look, Marshal.
That's probably not a good thing.

1053
01:25:30,084 --> 01:25:32,753
- Tell me something.
- Yeah.

1054
01:25:33,921 --> 01:25:35,714
What happened to you?

1055
01:25:36,549 --> 01:25:39,969
I started asking about these
large shipments of sodium amytal

1056
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:41,846
and opium-based hallucinogens.

1057
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:43,597
Psychotropic drugs.

1058
01:25:44,974 --> 01:25:47,351
I asked about the surgeries, too.

1059
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:51,564
You ever heard of
a transorbital lobotomy?

1060
01:25:53,107 --> 01:25:55,860
They zap the patient with electroshock,

1061
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:58,737
then go through the eye with an ice pick,

1062
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:02,992
pull out some nerve fibers.

1063
01:26:05,411 --> 01:26:07,913
Makes the patients much more obedient.

1064
01:26:07,955 --> 01:26:09,290
Tractable.

1065
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:12,251
It's barbaric,

1066
01:26:13,252 --> 01:26:14,753
unconscionable.

1067
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:19,508
Do you know how pain
enters the body, Marshal? Do you?

1068
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:22,261
Depends on where you're hurt?

1069
01:26:22,303 --> 01:26:24,847
No, it has nothing to do with the flesh.

1070
01:26:25,264 --> 01:26:27,266
The brain controls pain.

1071
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:32,479
The brain controls fear, empathy, sleep,
hunger, anger. Everything.

1072
01:26:34,815 --> 01:26:36,609
What if you could control it?

1073
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:40,112
- You mean the brain?
- Recreate a man

1074
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:45,367
so he doesn't feel pain or love
or sympathy.

1075
01:26:46,911 --> 01:26:48,412
A man who can't be interrogated,

1076
01:26:48,454 --> 01:26:51,165
because he has no memories
to confess.

1077
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:57,463
You can never take away
all a man's memories. Never.

1078
01:26:57,504 --> 01:27:01,634
Marshal, the North Koreans
used American POWs

1079
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:03,427
during their brainwashing experiments.

1080
01:27:03,469 --> 01:27:06,931
They turned soldiers into traitors.
That's what they're doing here.

1081
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:09,099
They're creating ghosts
to go out in the world

1082
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:12,394
and do things sane men...
Sane men never would.

1083
01:27:12,478 --> 01:27:15,814
To have that kind of ability,
that kind of knowledge,

1084
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:18,567
- that would take years.
- Years. Years of research.

1085
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:21,362
Hundreds of patients to experiment on.

1086
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:26,575
Fifty years from now, people will
look back and say, here, this place,

1087
01:27:26,909 --> 01:27:29,161
is where it all began.

1088
01:27:29,203 --> 01:27:33,999
The Nazis used the Jews, Soviets used
prisoners in their own Gulags, and we,

1089
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:38,295
we tested patients on Shutter Island.

1090
01:27:39,964 --> 01:27:41,632
No, they won't.

1091
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:43,592
No.

1092
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:48,180
You do understand

1093
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:53,018
that they can't let you leave.

1094
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:56,647
I am a federal marshal.
They can't stop me.

1095
01:27:58,023 --> 01:28:03,112
I was an esteemed psychiatrist
from a respected family.

1096
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:06,824
Didn't matter.

1097
01:28:09,535 --> 01:28:13,580
Let me ask you.
Any past traumas in your life?

1098
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:16,208
Yes.

1099
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:19,461
But why would that matter?

1100
01:28:19,545 --> 01:28:21,880
Because they're gonna point
to some event in your past

1101
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:24,425
and say it's the reason
you lost your sanity.

1102
01:28:24,508 --> 01:28:29,888
So that when they commit you here,
your friends and colleagues will say,

1103
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:31,890
"Of course he cracked.

1104
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:34,184
"Who wouldn't
after what he'd been through?"

1105
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:36,729
They can say that about anyone,
anyone at all.

1106
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:39,773
The point is
they're gonna say it about you.

1107
01:28:43,027 --> 01:28:46,864
- How's your head?
- My head?

1108
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:50,326
Any funny dreams lately?
Trouble sleeping?

1109
01:28:52,536 --> 01:28:56,915
- Headaches?
- I am prone to migraines, yes.

1110
01:28:56,957 --> 01:28:58,250
Jesus.

1111
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:04,089
You haven't taken any pills, have you?
I mean, even aspirin?

1112
01:29:04,131 --> 01:29:06,300
- The aspirin?
- Jesus.

1113
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:10,679
And you ate the food in the cafeteria
and drank the coffee they gave you?

1114
01:29:10,763 --> 01:29:14,141
You tell me, at least, that you've
been smoking your own cigarettes.

1115
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:17,144
No.

1116
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:19,229
No.

1117
01:29:20,314 --> 01:29:21,690
No, I haven't.

1118
01:29:21,774 --> 01:29:24,568
It takes 36 to 48 hours
for neuroleptic narcotics

1119
01:29:24,610 --> 01:29:27,196
to reach workable levels
in the bloodstream.

1120
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:30,824
Palsy comes first,

1121
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:35,204
first the fingertips,
then eventually the whole hand.

1122
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:40,292
Seen any walking nightmares
lately, Marshal? Huh?

1123
01:29:42,795 --> 01:29:45,756
Tell me what goes on in that lighthouse.

1124
01:29:46,632 --> 01:29:47,966
Tell me.

1125
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:50,761
Brain surgery.

1126
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:55,891
The let's-open-the-skull-and-see-
what-happens-if-we-pull-on-this kind.

1127
01:29:56,433 --> 01:29:59,311
The learned-it-from-the-Nazis kind.

1128
01:30:01,397 --> 01:30:03,857
That's where they create the ghosts.

1129
01:30:05,275 --> 01:30:09,154
Who knows about this?
On the island, I mean. Who?

1130
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:12,783
Everyone.

1131
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:16,537
Come on. The nurses? The orderlies?

1132
01:30:17,121 --> 01:30:20,416
- They couldn't possibly know...
- Everyone.

1133
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:40,894
You can't stay here.

1134
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:42,855
They think I'm dead, that I drowned.

1135
01:30:42,896 --> 01:30:45,899
I'm afraid if they come looking for you,
they might find me.

1136
01:30:45,983 --> 01:30:48,360
I'm sorry, but you have to go.

1137
01:30:54,992 --> 01:30:56,618
I'm gonna come back for you.

1138
01:30:56,702 --> 01:30:59,705
I won't be here. I move during the day.
New places every night.

1139
01:30:59,746 --> 01:31:02,082
But I could come get you,
get you off this island.

1140
01:31:02,166 --> 01:31:04,084
Haven't you heard a word I've said?

1141
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:08,213
The only way off the island is the ferry,
and they control it.

1142
01:31:09,173 --> 01:31:11,216
You'll never leave here.

1143
01:31:20,559 --> 01:31:22,394
I had a friend.

1144
01:31:22,436 --> 01:31:24,938
I was with him yesterday,
but we got separated.

1145
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:27,733
Have you seen him?

1146
01:31:28,901 --> 01:31:30,235
Marshal,

1147
01:31:31,778 --> 01:31:33,906
you have no friends.

1148
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:07,773
There you are.

1149
01:32:10,609 --> 01:32:13,278
We were wondering
when you'd show up.

1150
01:32:14,905 --> 01:32:16,448
Have a seat.

1151
01:32:16,907 --> 01:32:18,200
Come on.

1152
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:31,505
Taking a leisurely stroll, were we?

1153
01:32:32,589 --> 01:32:35,634
I was just looking around.

1154
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:41,014
Did you enjoy God's latest gift?

1155
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:43,976
- What?
- God's gift.

1156
01:32:46,144 --> 01:32:47,479
The violence.

1157
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:54,695
When I came downstairs in my home
and I saw that tree in my living room,

1158
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:58,615
it reached out for me like a divine hand.

1159
01:33:00,826 --> 01:33:02,661
God loves violence.

1160
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:08,166
- I hadn't noticed.
- Sure you have.

1161
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:11,503
Why else would there be so much of it?

1162
01:33:11,837 --> 01:33:13,213
It's in us.

1163
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:15,090
It's what we are.

1164
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:18,844
We wage war, we burn sacrifices,

1165
01:33:18,927 --> 01:33:21,513
and pillage and plunder
and tear at the flesh of our brothers.

1166
01:33:21,555 --> 01:33:25,475
And why? Because God gave us
violence to wage in his honor.

1167
01:33:28,687 --> 01:33:31,106
I thought God gave us moral order.

1168
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:34,192
There's no moral order
as pure as this storm.

1169
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:38,363
There's no moral order at all.
There's just this,

1170
01:33:38,989 --> 01:33:41,158
can my violence conquer yours?

1171
01:33:46,538 --> 01:33:48,957
- I'm not violent.
- Yes, you are.

1172
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:52,502
You're as violent as they come.

1173
01:33:53,211 --> 01:33:56,840
I know this
because I'm as violent as they come.

1174
01:33:56,882 --> 01:33:59,051
If the constraints of society were lifted,

1175
01:33:59,134 --> 01:34:01,803
and I was all that stood
between you and a meal,

1176
01:34:01,887 --> 01:34:05,265
you would crack my skull with a rock
and eat my meaty parts.

1177
01:34:07,225 --> 01:34:08,810
Wouldn't you?

1178
01:34:11,563 --> 01:34:14,066
Cawley thinks you're harmless,
that you can be controlled,

1179
01:34:14,107 --> 01:34:15,984
but I know different.

1180
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:18,403
- You don't know me.
- Oh, but I do.

1181
01:34:18,445 --> 01:34:21,073
- No, you don't. You don't know me at all.
- Oh, I know you.

1182
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:24,409
We've known each other for centuries.

1183
01:34:33,752 --> 01:34:36,713
If I was to sink my teeth
into your eye right now,

1184
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:40,092
would you be able to stop me
before I blinded you?

1185
01:34:44,221 --> 01:34:45,847
Give it a try.

1186
01:34:47,391 --> 01:34:49,101
That's the spirit.

1187
01:35:23,844 --> 01:35:27,180
Don't worry, because we're going
to get you back to your room.

1188
01:35:28,098 --> 01:35:29,808
- Not really.
- Something I've seen.

1189
01:35:29,850 --> 01:35:31,101
Okay.

1190
01:35:36,314 --> 01:35:38,066
Where have you been?

1191
01:35:38,150 --> 01:35:40,902
Oh, just wandering.
Just looking at your island.

1192
01:35:40,986 --> 01:35:44,656
Oh, I forgot you're leaving
now that Rachel's been found.

1193
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:46,950
- Stop looking at him.
- For sure. Yeah.

1194
01:35:46,992 --> 01:35:49,035
Stop looking at him. Stop looking at him.

1195
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:52,164
- Big meeting?
- Oh, yes.

1196
01:35:52,247 --> 01:35:53,498
- It's okay. I'm...
- I don't like that.

1197
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:56,168
Apparently there was
an unidentified man

1198
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:57,544
in Ward C yesterday.

1199
01:35:57,627 --> 01:36:01,006
He subdued a highly dangerous patient
quite handily.

1200
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:02,591
Is that so?

1201
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:05,177
It seems he had a long conversation
with a paranoid schizophrenic,

1202
01:36:05,218 --> 01:36:06,428
George Noyce.

1203
01:36:06,511 --> 01:36:09,347
Well, I don't remember
what I'm supposed to remember.

1204
01:36:09,389 --> 01:36:11,141
We're gated down. We're fine.

1205
01:36:11,183 --> 01:36:15,228
This Noyce, you said his name was,
he's delusional?

1206
01:36:15,312 --> 01:36:18,023
Oh, extremely.
He can be quite upsetting.

1207
01:36:18,106 --> 01:36:19,858
As a matter of fact, two weeks ago,

1208
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:24,362
a patient got so wound up by one
of Noyce's stories that he beat him up.

1209
01:36:25,071 --> 01:36:26,531
- Hmm.
- Cigarette?

1210
01:36:28,825 --> 01:36:30,619
No, thanks. I quit.

1211
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:35,749
- So you're taking the ferry?
- Yes, absolutely.

1212
01:36:35,832 --> 01:36:38,543
I think we've gotten
all we came here for, so...

1213
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:40,712
"We," Marshal?

1214
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:46,301
Speaking of which,
have you seen him, Doctor?

1215
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:47,552
Who?

1216
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:50,096
My partner, Chuck.

1217
01:36:52,432 --> 01:36:55,268
You don't have a partner, Marshal.
You came here alone.

1218
01:36:57,729 --> 01:36:59,898
You know, I've built
something valuable here,

1219
01:36:59,981 --> 01:37:03,151
and valuable things have a way of
being misunderstood in their own time.

1220
01:37:03,235 --> 01:37:05,320
Everyone wants a quick fix.
They always have.

1221
01:37:05,403 --> 01:37:09,032
I'm trying to do something that people,
yourself included, don't understand.

1222
01:37:09,074 --> 01:37:12,035
And I'm not going to give up
without a fight.

1223
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:15,497
I can see that.

1224
01:37:17,415 --> 01:37:18,542
Mmm.

1225
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:22,212
So, tell me again about your partner.

1226
01:37:23,922 --> 01:37:25,549
What partner?

1227
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:29,386
It's fine.

1228
01:38:17,726 --> 01:38:21,146
She made a mess.
I cleaned it up. She made a mess again.

1229
01:38:30,822 --> 01:38:32,198
Marshal,

1230
01:38:33,575 --> 01:38:35,201
going somewhere?

1231
01:38:35,493 --> 01:38:38,413
I'm just
heading out to the ferry, so...

1232
01:38:38,496 --> 01:38:42,042
Ah! Oh, well, I'm afraid it's the other way.

1233
01:38:43,585 --> 01:38:44,669
Oh?

1234
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:50,342
If you'll wait a moment, I'll find you
someone who can take you to the dock.

1235
01:38:55,013 --> 01:38:58,850
- What's this, Doctor? Huh? What's this?
- It's just a sedative.

1236
01:38:58,934 --> 01:39:02,103
- A precaution.
- Oh! A precaution.

1237
01:39:04,314 --> 01:39:07,901
What are you going to do? Kill me?

1238
01:39:08,234 --> 01:39:11,029
- Marshal.
- You think you deserve it?

1239
01:39:11,112 --> 01:39:13,907
For what, hmm? Provoking you?

1240
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:17,535
Well, forgive me.
What doesn't provoke you?

1241
01:39:18,078 --> 01:39:21,039
- Remarks? Words?
- Nazis?

1242
01:39:21,665 --> 01:39:25,710
Well, that, too.
And, of course, memories, dreams.

1243
01:39:26,795 --> 01:39:31,049
Did you know that the word "trauma"
comes from the Greek for "wound"?

1244
01:39:31,716 --> 01:39:34,469
And what is the German word
for "dream"?

1245
01:39:34,552 --> 01:39:36,721
<i>Traum. Ein Traum.</i>

1246
01:39:38,098 --> 01:39:41,059
Wounds can create monsters,
and you...

1247
01:39:41,726 --> 01:39:44,104
You are wounded, Marshal.

1248
01:39:45,146 --> 01:39:48,316
And wouldn't you agree,
when you see a monster,

1249
01:39:49,025 --> 01:39:50,777
you must stop it?

1250
01:39:51,361 --> 01:39:52,570
Yeah.

1251
01:39:53,738 --> 01:39:55,573
- I agree.
- Yes.

1252
01:39:56,408 --> 01:39:57,492
Yeah.

1253
01:40:14,718 --> 01:40:16,970
I told him that we'd take
about an hour to do it.

1254
01:40:17,053 --> 01:40:20,140
Yeah. Did they say
we're going to do the first floor?

1255
01:40:20,223 --> 01:40:21,474
How long
you been the clock?

1256
01:40:21,558 --> 01:40:23,935
I've been on
for 18 hours straight.

1257
01:40:24,394 --> 01:40:25,937
Nice paycheck.

1258
01:40:42,412 --> 01:40:44,497
What are you doing, baby?

1259
01:40:49,294 --> 01:40:51,796
- You gotta get to the ferry.
- No.

1260
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:53,840
No, no.

1261
01:40:55,050 --> 01:40:56,217
Yeah.

1262
01:40:57,343 --> 01:41:02,223
If the world thinks that Chuck is dead,
then he's perfect for their experiments.

1263
01:41:03,308 --> 01:41:05,560
There's only one place they'd take him.

1264
01:41:08,188 --> 01:41:10,732
- You go there and you'll die.
- He's my partner.

1265
01:41:10,815 --> 01:41:12,901
If they are hurting him,
if they're holding him against his will,

1266
01:41:12,984 --> 01:41:14,694
I've gotta bring him out.

1267
01:41:14,903 --> 01:41:16,988
I can't lose anyone else.

1268
01:41:17,030 --> 01:41:18,323
Don't go, Teddy, please.

1269
01:41:18,364 --> 01:41:21,785
- Please, don't do this. Don't go.
- I'm sorry, honey.

1270
01:41:25,371 --> 01:41:27,165
I'm sorry, honey.

1271
01:41:28,249 --> 01:41:31,294
I love this thing
because you gave it to me,

1272
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:35,507
but the truth is

1273
01:41:37,175 --> 01:41:39,344
it is one fucking ugly tie.

1274
01:42:19,551 --> 01:42:20,718
No.

1275
01:43:42,634 --> 01:43:44,010
Don't move. Stay where you are.

1276
01:43:46,012 --> 01:43:47,430
Are you gonna kill me?

1277
01:43:49,098 --> 01:43:51,643
No, I'm not gonna kill you.

1278
01:45:44,255 --> 01:45:46,132
Why are you all wet, baby?

1279
01:45:48,343 --> 01:45:51,596
- What did you say?
- You know exactly what I said.

1280
01:46:04,692 --> 01:46:06,944
The rifle's empty, by the way.

1281
01:46:13,451 --> 01:46:14,952
Have a seat.

1282
01:46:21,459 --> 01:46:23,878
For God's sake, dry off.
You'll catch cold.

1283
01:46:25,505 --> 01:46:26,631
All right.

1284
01:46:30,176 --> 01:46:32,095
How badly did you hurt the guard?

1285
01:46:33,805 --> 01:46:36,808
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1286
01:46:39,977 --> 01:46:41,938
Yes, he's here.

1287
01:46:41,979 --> 01:46:45,983
Have Dr. Sheehan take a look
at your man before you send him up.

1288
01:46:46,067 --> 01:46:50,780
So Dr. Sheehan came in on the ferry
this morning, huh?

1289
01:46:51,739 --> 01:46:53,241
Not exactly.

1290
01:46:54,283 --> 01:46:57,328
You blew up my car.
I really loved that car.

1291
01:46:58,246 --> 01:47:00,331
Sorry to hear about that.

1292
01:47:03,626 --> 01:47:06,003
Tremors are getting pretty bad.

1293
01:47:06,629 --> 01:47:09,048
How are the hallucinations?

1294
01:47:09,132 --> 01:47:13,302
Get out of here, Teddy.
This place is gonna be the end of you.

1295
01:47:17,056 --> 01:47:18,182
Not bad.

1296
01:47:18,266 --> 01:47:20,852
- They'll get worse.
- I know.

1297
01:47:21,727 --> 01:47:26,023
Dr. Solando,
she told me about the neuroleptics.

1298
01:47:26,566 --> 01:47:29,026
Did she, now? And when was this?

1299
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:33,906
I found her, Doctor,
in a cave out by the cliffs.

1300
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:36,534
- But you'll never get to her.
- I don't doubt it,

1301
01:47:37,493 --> 01:47:39,162
considering she's not real.

1302
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:44,208
Your delusions are more severe
than I thought.

1303
01:47:45,418 --> 01:47:47,587
You're not on neuroleptics.

1304
01:47:48,045 --> 01:47:49,922
You're not on anything,
as a matter of fact.

1305
01:47:50,006 --> 01:47:52,633
Then what the fuck is this? Huh?
What the fuck is this?

1306
01:47:52,717 --> 01:47:53,718
Withdrawal.

1307
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:56,721
Withdrawal? From what?

1308
01:47:56,762 --> 01:47:59,098
I haven't had a goddamn drink
since I've been on this island.

1309
01:47:59,182 --> 01:48:00,808
Chlorpromazine.

1310
01:48:01,642 --> 01:48:04,896
I'm not a fan of pharmacology,
but I have to say, in your case...

1311
01:48:05,396 --> 01:48:08,649
- Chloraproma-what?
- Chlorpromazine.

1312
01:48:08,733 --> 01:48:12,737
The same thing we've been giving you
for the past 24 months.

1313
01:48:14,030 --> 01:48:16,157
Oh, so for the past two years, you...

1314
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:19,577
You've had somebody slipping me drugs
in Boston. Is that it?

1315
01:48:19,619 --> 01:48:21,078
Not Boston.

1316
01:48:21,579 --> 01:48:22,747
Here.

1317
01:48:23,539 --> 01:48:27,502
You've been here for two years.
A patient of this institution.

1318
01:48:31,255 --> 01:48:33,424
After everything I've seen here, Doctor,

1319
01:48:35,092 --> 01:48:38,513
you really think you're gonna
convince me I'm crazy, huh?

1320
01:48:38,596 --> 01:48:40,598
Do you know the kind of people
that I deal with every day?

1321
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:42,517
I'm a U.S. Marshal, for God's sakes.

1322
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:44,477
You were a U.S. Marshal.

1323
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:48,356
Here's a copy of the intake form
you broke into Ward C for.

1324
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:49,815
Proof of the 67th patient.

1325
01:48:49,899 --> 01:48:51,108
If you'd gotten it to the mainland,

1326
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:52,944
you could have blown the lid
off this place.

1327
01:48:53,027 --> 01:48:54,445
- Wait. Where did... Where did you...
- Yet somehow,

1328
01:48:54,487 --> 01:48:57,406
you couldn't find time to look at it.
Well, read it now.

1329
01:48:58,282 --> 01:48:59,659
Go ahead.

1330
01:49:03,454 --> 01:49:07,291
"Patient is highly intelligent, highly
delusional decorated Army veteran.

1331
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:09,961
"Present
for the liberation of Dachau.

1332
01:49:11,212 --> 01:49:13,839
"Former U.S. Marshal.
Known proclivity for violence.

1333
01:49:13,923 --> 01:49:17,176
"Shows no remorse for his crime
because he denies the crime ever...

1334
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:18,302
"Ever took place.

1335
01:49:18,386 --> 01:49:20,304
"Highly developed
and fantastical narratives,

1336
01:49:20,346 --> 01:49:22,723
"which preclude
facing the truth of his actions."

1337
01:49:22,807 --> 01:49:25,476
I've had enough of this bullshit!
Where's my partner, huh?

1338
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:27,144
Where's Chuck? Where is he?

1339
01:49:27,937 --> 01:49:29,647
Let's try this another way.

1340
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:32,316
Your wife's maiden name was Chanal,
am I correct?

1341
01:49:32,358 --> 01:49:33,818
Don't you even talk about her.
Don't you...

1342
01:49:33,859 --> 01:49:35,736
I'm afraid I have to.

1343
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:39,949
Notice anything
these four names have in common?

1344
01:49:40,157 --> 01:49:41,659
It's your rule of four.

1345
01:49:42,118 --> 01:49:43,286
Andrew, what do you see?

1346
01:49:43,327 --> 01:49:46,330
If you've done anything to my partner,
Doctor, that is a violation of...

1347
01:49:46,414 --> 01:49:48,833
Focus, Andrew! What do you see?

1348
01:49:49,834 --> 01:49:52,336
The names have the same letters.

1349
01:49:53,212 --> 01:49:56,674
Edward Daniels has exactly
the same 13 letters as Andrew Laeddis.

1350
01:49:56,716 --> 01:49:58,968
The same as Rachel Solando
and Dolores Chanal.

1351
01:49:59,010 --> 01:50:01,095
The names are anagrams
for each other.

1352
01:50:01,178 --> 01:50:03,764
Your tactics,
they're not gonna work on me.

1353
01:50:03,848 --> 01:50:06,684
You came here for the truth. Here it is.

1354
01:50:06,726 --> 01:50:08,728
Your name is Andrew Laeddis.

1355
01:50:08,811 --> 01:50:12,356
The 67th patient at Ashecliffe
is you, Andrew.

1356
01:50:14,191 --> 01:50:15,192
Bullshit.

1357
01:50:15,234 --> 01:50:17,445
You were committed here by court order
24 months ago.

1358
01:50:17,528 --> 01:50:20,865
Your crime is terrible,
one you can't forgive yourself for,

1359
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:23,326
so you invented another self.

1360
01:50:25,494 --> 01:50:26,912
All right.

1361
01:50:27,413 --> 01:50:30,082
Let's get down
to the facts, all right?

1362
01:50:30,166 --> 01:50:33,044
You've created a story
in which you're not a murderer.

1363
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:37,214
You're a hero, still a U.S. Marshal, only
here at Ashecliffe because of a case,

1364
01:50:37,256 --> 01:50:38,758
and you've uncovered a conspiracy

1365
01:50:38,841 --> 01:50:42,386
so that anything we tell you
about who you are, what you've done,

1366
01:50:42,470 --> 01:50:44,555
you can dismiss as lies, Andrew.

1367
01:50:44,597 --> 01:50:45,890
My name is Edward Daniels.

1368
01:50:45,973 --> 01:50:50,227
I've been hearing this fantasy
for two years now. I know every detail.

1369
01:50:50,311 --> 01:50:52,271
Patient 67, the storm,

1370
01:50:52,355 --> 01:50:55,566
Rachel Solando, your missing partner,
the dreams you have every night.

1371
01:50:55,650 --> 01:50:58,069
You were at Dachau,
but you may not have killed any guards.

1372
01:51:02,114 --> 01:51:05,785
I wish I could let you
just live in your fantasy world.

1373
01:51:05,868 --> 01:51:07,328
I really do.

1374
01:51:08,204 --> 01:51:10,414
But you're violent, trained, dangerous.

1375
01:51:10,498 --> 01:51:12,792
You're the most dangerous patient
we have.

1376
01:51:12,875 --> 01:51:15,169
You've injured orderlies, guards,
other patients.

1377
01:51:15,252 --> 01:51:17,213
Two weeks ago,
you attacked George Noyce.

1378
01:51:17,254 --> 01:51:19,548
No, no. I am fucking on to you, Doctor.

1379
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:21,467
- You had Noyce beaten.
- Of course I didn't!

1380
01:51:21,550 --> 01:51:23,636
Give me one reason
why I would even touch him!

1381
01:51:23,719 --> 01:51:26,097
Because he called you Laeddis,

1382
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:29,266
and you'd do anything not to be him.

1383
01:51:29,308 --> 01:51:32,937
I have a transcript of the conversation
you had with Noyce yesterday.

1384
01:51:32,978 --> 01:51:37,024
"This is about you, and, Laeddis,
that's all it's ever been about."

1385
01:51:38,943 --> 01:51:41,445
No, no. He's saying
this is about me and Laeddis.

1386
01:51:41,529 --> 01:51:43,447
When you asked him
what happened to his face,

1387
01:51:43,489 --> 01:51:46,909
he said, now here I'm quoting again,
"You did this."

1388
01:51:46,951 --> 01:51:49,120
No, no, he meant that it was my fault.

1389
01:51:49,161 --> 01:51:51,163
You almost killed him.

1390
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:55,626
The warden and the Board of Overseers
are determined something be done.

1391
01:51:55,710 --> 01:51:57,461
It's been decided

1392
01:51:57,503 --> 01:52:00,339
that unless we can bring you
back to sanity now,

1393
01:52:00,631 --> 01:52:01,924
right now,

1394
01:52:02,216 --> 01:52:05,636
permanent measures will be taken to
ensure you can't hurt anyone ever again.

1395
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:12,476
They'll lobotomize you, Andrew.
Do you understand?

1396
01:52:16,731 --> 01:52:18,649
Yeah, I understand.

1397
01:52:19,483 --> 01:52:21,694
I understand just fine.

1398
01:52:22,319 --> 01:52:26,407
If I don't play along
with your little game here,

1399
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:29,618
Dr. Naehring's gonna turn me
into one of his ghosts.

1400
01:52:30,077 --> 01:52:31,495
But what about my partner?

1401
01:52:31,537 --> 01:52:36,000
You gonna tell the U.S. Marshal's office
that he's a defense mechanism?

1402
01:52:37,877 --> 01:52:39,336
Hello, boss.

1403
01:52:56,187 --> 01:52:59,356
What the fuck
is going on here? Hmm?

1404
01:53:00,441 --> 01:53:01,525
Huh?

1405
01:53:01,859 --> 01:53:05,488
You working for him?

1406
01:53:06,322 --> 01:53:07,865
I'm sorry. There wasn't any other way.

1407
01:53:07,907 --> 01:53:10,826
Someone had to stick with you,
keep you safe.

1408
01:53:13,704 --> 01:53:15,831
You been watching me, huh?

1409
01:53:16,791 --> 01:53:18,876
Watching me every minute.

1410
01:53:19,794 --> 01:53:21,086
Who are you?

1411
01:53:21,837 --> 01:53:22,922
Who are you? Tell me.

1412
01:53:23,589 --> 01:53:25,591
Don't you recognize me, Andrew?

1413
01:53:27,009 --> 01:53:30,721
I've been your primary psychiatrist
for the last two years.

1414
01:53:31,305 --> 01:53:33,182
I'm Lester Sheehan.

1415
01:53:39,647 --> 01:53:42,316
- I told you... I told you about my wife, I...
- I know.

1416
01:53:42,399 --> 01:53:45,653
I climbed down a cliff to get you.
I trusted you.

1417
01:53:45,736 --> 01:53:49,406
I risked everything to come in here
after you. Everything!

1418
01:53:49,448 --> 01:53:52,201
- I know, boss.
- We're running out of time here, Andrew.

1419
01:53:53,744 --> 01:53:55,329
I swore before the Board of Overseers

1420
01:53:55,412 --> 01:53:59,333
that I could construct the most radical,
cutting-edge role-play

1421
01:53:59,416 --> 01:54:01,710
ever attempted in psychiatry,
and it would bring you back.

1422
01:54:01,752 --> 01:54:04,129
I thought that if we let you play this out

1423
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:08,509
we could get you to see how untrue,
how impossible it is.

1424
01:54:09,593 --> 01:54:12,096
You've had the run of the place
for two days.

1425
01:54:12,137 --> 01:54:15,432
Tell me, where are
the Nazi experiments?

1426
01:54:15,516 --> 01:54:17,309
The satanic ORs?

1427
01:54:30,948 --> 01:54:34,493
Andrew, listen to me.

1428
01:54:35,202 --> 01:54:36,787
If we fail with you,

1429
01:54:37,538 --> 01:54:41,458
then everything that we've tried to do
here will be discredited. Everything.

1430
01:54:43,586 --> 01:54:46,755
We're on the front lines of a war
here, old boy.

1431
01:54:47,506 --> 01:54:50,384
And right now, it all comes down to you.

1432
01:54:57,308 --> 01:55:00,019
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Andrew! Andrew! No. No.

1433
01:55:00,102 --> 01:55:03,314
My name
is Edward Daniels!

1434
01:55:03,397 --> 01:55:05,482
This one's loaded.
I can tell by the weight.

1435
01:55:05,524 --> 01:55:08,152
I see. And that's your firearm, Marshal?
You're sure?

1436
01:55:08,193 --> 01:55:09,403
My initials are on the side.

1437
01:55:09,486 --> 01:55:11,822
There's a dent in the barrel
from when Philip Stacks shot at me.

1438
01:55:11,864 --> 01:55:13,991
You're not gonna fuck with my mind
on this one, Doctor!

1439
01:55:14,074 --> 01:55:15,159
Then blast away.

1440
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:18,537
Because that's the only way
you're ever getting off this island.

1441
01:55:24,627 --> 01:55:26,503
Andrew, please don't.

1442
01:55:37,389 --> 01:55:38,682
My gun.

1443
01:55:45,272 --> 01:55:47,858
What did you do to my goddamn gun?

1444
01:55:48,275 --> 01:55:50,444
It's a toy, Andrew.

1445
01:55:52,947 --> 01:55:55,032
We're telling you the truth.

1446
01:55:55,532 --> 01:55:58,786
Dolores was insane,
manic-depressive, suicidal.

1447
01:55:59,453 --> 01:56:02,539
You drank, stayed away,
ignored what everyone told you.

1448
01:56:02,623 --> 01:56:03,749
You moved to that lake house

1449
01:56:03,832 --> 01:56:07,002
after she purposely set
your city apartment on fire.

1450
01:56:07,044 --> 01:56:08,379
- You were...
- You're lying!

1451
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:11,882
- Andrew! Andrew, stop. No.
- You drugged the cigarettes!

1452
01:56:11,966 --> 01:56:13,842
- All you've done is lie!
- Andrew. Andrew.

1453
01:56:13,884 --> 01:56:16,428
Your children. Andrew, your children.

1454
01:56:17,179 --> 01:56:19,848
Simon. Henry.

1455
01:56:20,224 --> 01:56:21,558
I never had any children.

1456
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:25,646
Your wife drowned them
at the cabin by the lake.

1457
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:28,941
And here, the little girl,
the one you dream of

1458
01:56:29,650 --> 01:56:31,318
every night.

1459
01:56:31,402 --> 01:56:32,569
I never had a little girl.

1460
01:56:32,653 --> 01:56:36,240
The one who tells you over and over
that you should have saved her,

1461
01:56:36,323 --> 01:56:38,242
saved them all.

1462
01:56:38,325 --> 01:56:40,786
Your daughter, her name was Rachel.

1463
01:56:40,869 --> 01:56:43,747
Are you going to deny
that she ever lived?

1464
01:56:44,498 --> 01:56:46,250
Andrew, are you?

1465
01:57:09,231 --> 01:57:11,316
I'm so sorry, baby.

1466
01:57:15,696 --> 01:57:18,073
I told you not to come in here.

1467
01:57:18,532 --> 01:57:22,494
I told you this would be the end of you.

1468
01:57:42,848 --> 01:57:44,183
I'm back!

1469
01:57:44,808 --> 01:57:47,561
We got him just outside of Oklahoma.

1470
01:57:47,644 --> 01:57:50,189
Must've stopped 10 places
in between here and Tulsa.

1471
01:57:50,272 --> 01:57:52,357
I could sleep for a week.

1472
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:57,654
Dolores?

1473
01:58:04,536 --> 01:58:05,871
Dolores?

1474
01:58:10,667 --> 01:58:13,003
<i>And he said, "Take up
your bed and walk." But God?</i>

1475
01:58:13,045 --> 01:58:14,129
Dolores?

1476
01:58:14,171 --> 01:58:15,506
<i>Then he said, "Take up
your bed and walk."</i>

1477
01:58:15,547 --> 01:58:17,549
<i>Forgive sins, but God?</i>

1478
01:58:28,519 --> 01:58:29,895
Dolores?

1479
01:58:55,212 --> 01:58:56,463
Baby,

1480
01:58:58,507 --> 01:59:00,384
why are you all wet?

1481
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:04,263
I missed you.

1482
01:59:11,645 --> 01:59:13,313
I wanna go home.

1483
01:59:16,441 --> 01:59:17,943
You are home.

1484
01:59:23,115 --> 01:59:24,950
Where are the kids?

1485
01:59:27,578 --> 01:59:28,579
Hmm?

1486
01:59:28,996 --> 01:59:30,747
They're in school.

1487
01:59:34,918 --> 01:59:36,920
It's Saturday, honey.

1488
01:59:38,088 --> 01:59:40,299
School's not in on Saturday.

1489
01:59:42,926 --> 01:59:44,553
My school is.

1490
01:59:57,900 --> 01:59:59,443
Oh, my God.

1491
02:00:01,737 --> 02:00:03,197
Oh, my God!

1492
02:00:16,335 --> 02:00:19,046
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1493
02:00:23,217 --> 02:00:24,801
Oh, my God, no.

1494
02:00:28,889 --> 02:00:29,890
Come on, come on.

1495
02:00:44,196 --> 02:00:47,324
No. No. Please, God.

1496
02:00:49,326 --> 02:00:50,827
Please, God, no!

1497
02:00:51,036 --> 02:00:54,081
No!

1498
02:00:56,333 --> 02:00:57,459
No.

1499
02:01:02,965 --> 02:01:04,091
No.

1500
02:01:06,593 --> 02:01:07,844
No.

1501
02:01:52,222 --> 02:01:53,432
Baby.

1502
02:02:12,242 --> 02:02:14,745
Let's put them at the table, Andrew.

1503
02:02:15,579 --> 02:02:18,790
We'll dry them off.
We'll change their clothes.

1504
02:02:20,959 --> 02:02:23,378
They'll be our living dolls. Huh?

1505
02:02:27,424 --> 02:02:30,177
Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic.

1506
02:02:35,182 --> 02:02:37,142
If you ever loved me, Dolores,

1507
02:02:38,518 --> 02:02:40,062
please stop talking.

1508
02:02:46,276 --> 02:02:47,778
I love you.

1509
02:02:56,495 --> 02:02:58,080
Set me free.

1510
02:03:02,751 --> 02:03:04,169
Oh, baby.

1511
02:03:07,631 --> 02:03:09,549
We'll give them baths.

1512
02:03:12,803 --> 02:03:16,014
- I love you, baby.
- I love you, too.

1513
02:03:16,098 --> 02:03:17,933
- I love you so much.
- I love you so much.

1514
02:03:17,974 --> 02:03:18,975
I love you. I...

1515
02:03:42,916 --> 02:03:45,502
Oh, baby.

1516
02:03:51,299 --> 02:03:52,634
Andrew.

1517
02:03:54,678 --> 02:03:56,680
Andrew, can you hear me?

1518
02:03:56,972 --> 02:04:00,851
Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.

1519
02:04:03,103 --> 02:04:04,396
Rachel?

1520
02:04:06,898 --> 02:04:08,358
Rachel who?

1521
02:04:11,236 --> 02:04:13,321
Rachel. Rachel Laeddis.

1522
02:04:14,489 --> 02:04:16,241
My daughter.

1523
02:04:19,828 --> 02:04:21,580
Why are you here?

1524
02:04:24,791 --> 02:04:26,376
Because I killed my wife.

1525
02:04:26,418 --> 02:04:28,545
And why did you do that?

1526
02:04:32,048 --> 02:04:35,218
Because she murdered our children,

1527
02:04:38,138 --> 02:04:39,681
and she told me to let her go.

1528
02:04:43,727 --> 02:04:46,897
- Who's Teddy Daniels?
- He doesn't exist.

1529
02:04:49,232 --> 02:04:51,735
Neither does Rachel Solando.
I made them up.

1530
02:04:51,776 --> 02:04:55,739
- Why?
- We need to hear you say it.

1531
02:05:02,329 --> 02:05:05,540
After she tried to kill herself
the first time,

1532
02:05:07,584 --> 02:05:09,544
Dolores told me she...

1533
02:05:10,504 --> 02:05:14,758
She had an insect living
inside her brain.

1534
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:21,473
She could feel it
clicking across her skull,

1535
02:05:21,556 --> 02:05:25,769
just pulling the wires just for fun.

1536
02:05:29,439 --> 02:05:31,233
She told me that.

1537
02:05:32,692 --> 02:05:35,529
She told me that, but I didn't listen.

1538
02:05:39,241 --> 02:05:41,535
I loved her so much, you know.

1539
02:05:42,953 --> 02:05:44,579
Why did you make them up?

1540
02:05:47,207 --> 02:05:51,127
Because I can't take knowing
that Dolores killed our children.

1541
02:05:54,965 --> 02:05:56,299
And I...

1542
02:05:58,802 --> 02:06:03,306
I killed them 'cause I didn't get her help,
you know.

1543
02:06:07,519 --> 02:06:09,145
I killed them.

1544
02:06:13,942 --> 02:06:15,110
Here's my fear, Andrew.

1545
02:06:15,151 --> 02:06:18,363
We broke through once before,
nine months ago,

1546
02:06:18,446 --> 02:06:19,447
and then you regressed.

1547
02:06:21,992 --> 02:06:25,328
- I don't remember that.
- I know.

1548
02:06:26,830 --> 02:06:28,623
You reset, Andrew.

1549
02:06:29,082 --> 02:06:33,169
Like a tape playing over and over
on an endless loop.

1550
02:06:34,421 --> 02:06:35,880
I hope that what we've done here
will be enough

1551
02:06:35,964 --> 02:06:39,092
to stop it from ever happening again,

1552
02:06:39,175 --> 02:06:42,679
but I need to know
you've accepted reality.

1553
02:06:49,185 --> 02:06:51,938
You came after me, huh, Doctor?

1554
02:06:53,815 --> 02:06:57,694
You tried to help me
when no one else would.

1555
02:07:09,497 --> 02:07:12,375
My name's Andrew Laeddis,

1556
02:07:19,382 --> 02:07:22,844
and I murdered my wife
in the spring of '52.

1557
02:07:47,577 --> 02:07:49,579
How we doing this morning?

1558
02:07:50,163 --> 02:07:53,416
- Good. And you?
- Can't complain.

1559
02:08:03,718 --> 02:08:05,303
So what's our next move?

1560
02:08:06,596 --> 02:08:08,056
You tell me.

1561
02:08:13,269 --> 02:08:15,105
We gotta get off this rock, Chuck.

1562
02:08:16,272 --> 02:08:17,607
Get back to the mainland.

1563
02:08:17,649 --> 02:08:20,610
Whatever the hell's going on here,
it's bad.

1564
02:08:42,549 --> 02:08:45,552
Don't worry, partner,
they're not gonna catch us.

1565
02:08:51,307 --> 02:08:54,144
That's right. We're too smart for them.

1566
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:57,397
Yeah, we are, aren't we?

1567
02:09:13,037 --> 02:09:15,790
You know,
this place makes me wonder...

1568
02:09:16,332 --> 02:09:18,418
Yeah, what's that, boss?

1569
02:09:19,377 --> 02:09:21,337
Which would be worse,

1570
02:09:22,172 --> 02:09:23,840
to live as a monster

1571
02:09:24,758 --> 02:09:26,426
or to die as a good man?

1572
02:09:36,144 --> 02:09:37,437
Teddy?
